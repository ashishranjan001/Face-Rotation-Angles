This app package was contains two executable files.
	1. Classify_Face_Angles.exe
	2. Classify_Face_Frontal_Angles.exe

Both executables take the same inputs and produce
the same outputs but in different formats. Either
one can be used as required.

INPUT

1. Path to dataset which needs to be classified.

2. Path to directory where the classified images
   will be stored. If the directory does not
   exist, it will be created.

3. Width of the images to be used while processing.
   It depends on the size of the faces in the
   images. For the QDF Dataset, a value of 300 was
   found to be appropriate.
